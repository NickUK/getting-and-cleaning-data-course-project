# Getting And Cleaning Data Coursera Project
My submission for the Coursera Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

### Contents
This repo contains my CodeBook.md containing details of variables, data and transformations of the original data found here:
http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones
https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

It also contains run_analysis.R which contains my submission for tidying the data set as per the assignment.

### Instructions
You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following.

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
1. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
1. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
1. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
1. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
